Remember, it's self-paced so feel free to take a break! ☕️

## Classic Snake

This repository now includes a minimal classic Snake game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Run locally

1. Start a static server from the repo root:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

### Manual checks

- Move the snake with arrow keys or WASD.
- Confirm the snake grows and the score increments when eating food.
- Verify the game ends when hitting the wall or itself, then restart with the button.
